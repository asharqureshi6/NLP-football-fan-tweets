13374,Sid_Kat,"That should have seen the back of the net by @MarcusRashford who mistimed his header. It was a brilliant ball in and it was the best chance of the game so far for @ManUtd with @WestHam playing with 8 defensive outfield players.

29985,Mayokuun,"Favoritism will be the end of @ManUtd give me a reason why rashford nd green wood stayed on nd cavani came off, Amad woulda shined in this match but no on the bench, @ManUtd football club is gone."
29986,fore7blue,Never win anything with these players @ManUtd just mark my words.
29987,HBRed99,"Things learnt from tonight's @ManUtd dismal #EPL 0-0 at @CPFC
#CRYMUN
1. Shockingly uninspired;
2. Passing atrocious;
3. Seriously lacked creativity;
4. Didn't look up for it at all; 
5. Lack a leader; &amp;
6. Should &amp; must do better.

29988,VedantUTD,"We need a CB, CM, CDM, RW and a back-up RB this summer. This rebuild will never end. 

Get a DOF @ManUtd FFS!!!!!!!!!"
29989,EkunStoner,"Make @ManUtd get out 
#CRYMUN"
29990,Joey_Ilozor,What a rubbish game @ManUtd
29991,AbasioduGodwin,The worst @manutd team ever https://t.co/KEDUr107TQ
29992,GhanaNYC,Ya mad annoying @ManUtd
29993,Assir522,Just sack Ole he will not be taking @ManUtd anywhere from where the team already sitting. Full of crap and riding on the his status of legendary player of #MUFC and if anyone else already long gone. Every game turns out to be embarrassing &amp; disappointment. #Oleout @SunManUtd
29994,liamkitchen,Boring boring @ManUtd. We either score lots but concede too many goals or we don’t concede and don’t score either. Just think if we actually had the forwards and defence all doing their job at the same time. On to the derby on Sunday and try and stop @ManCity’s winning run.
29995,Masa_Mills,Looked you all didn't want to be there. Glad fans are not allowed in the stadium because that was obscenely poor and lacked the spirit of the club. @ManUtd @B_Fernandes8 @MarcusRashford @masongreenwood
29996,Stiggy84,"Appalling, disgusting, disappointing! @ManUtd"
29997,J_T_Pritchard,"Don’t see what the fuss is about. Clean sheet and a point away from home against a relegation rival? Game management was excellent in the last 10 minutes to slow the game right down, @ManUtd keep it up ignore the haters👍 x"
29998,jj7jeffrey,Give me those 90 mins back @ManUtd
29999,AllBallerZone,Spoils are shared as @ManUtd fail to win at Crystal Palace. The goalless draw leaves the second placed Red Devils 14 points behind neighbours and league leaders @ManCity ahead of Sunday's Manchester derby. https://t.co/T5WFISmPjp
